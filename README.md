gojpegoptim
===========

An in memory jpegoptim chain toolkit for Go.

jpegoptim is a widely used tool to optimize jpeg size, but must implementation are using disk as buffer which is annoying on a resize farm.  
Here is an alternative using all in memory structs.  

Roadmap
=======
* jpeg buffer to jpeg buffer (void optimizeJPEG())

* RGB struct to jpegbuffer
